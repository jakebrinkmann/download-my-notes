# Download my notes

Instead of using Evernote "web-clipper", I now share information to a specific
email address. My inbox automatically filters these emails into a folder.

Goal: Everytime this script is run, it will download these emails as HTML or
plain text, and create a file locally on my computer. Then, it will delete the
message from my inbox.
